# Kishan S. Business Card (Next.js + Tailwind + TypeScript)

A sleek, responsive business card for Kishan S., Deputy Executive Director at Dr. Interested. Includes a subtle 3D tilt on hover, rounded corners, smooth transitions, and a soft shadow for depth.

npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open http://localhost:3000 to view the card.
